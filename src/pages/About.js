          <p>Hailing from the Golden State, Jennifer Einstein is known among her family and friends as an inventive gift giver. The best gift she ever received was 500 individual packets of mustard from her father after complaining that no one served yellow mustard in New York City, where she now lives. Jennifer aims to make the modern world a better place, one line of code at a time. </p>
